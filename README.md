# AJIVE_Project
This repository provides the AJIVE software in Matlab and all related Matlab scripts to reproduce the results in the paper 
**Angle-basied Joint And Individual Variation Explained** Feng et.al. (2017). 

The folder, *AJIVECode*, contains the scripts to implement AJIVE algorithm. The folder  *DataExample* provides the toy dataset, TCGA dataset and motarlity dataset in the paper. The folders *TCGA* and *Motarlity* provide the scripts to reproduce the corresponding figures for these two dataset in the paper. In order to utilize these scripts, the [*Marronâ€™s Matlab Softwares*](http://marron.web.unc.edu/sample-page/marrons-matlab-software/) are required to install.
